## Sharing State & Updating the Search Components

```javascript
  state = {
    searchTerm: ""
  }
  props: {
    shows: Array<Show>
  }
  
  //for maybe Array of shows
  props: {
    shows?: Array<Show>
  }
  
```

## Finishing the Details Component

Mostly just added the Details Component


## Creating a Header Component

Convention: Own components use Uppercase in the beginning, for custom html items use smaller case in the beginning.

## React Lifecycle methods

Just general lifecycle hooks discussion
