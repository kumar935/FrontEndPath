### Primitive and Reference Values

JS variables can ___contain___ 2 type of data: __Primitive__ and __Reference__.

__Primitive__: These are atomic pieces of data. Integers, String, Boolean, Null and Undefined are Primitive values.
__Reference__: These maybe made up of multiple values. Objects are reference values.

Primitive type variables are said to be accessed by their values. Whereas while manipulating objects we work with the references to these objects rather than the actual object itself.
